# purely-functional-data-structures

SML code that began as implementations of the data structures from the first chapter of the book [Purely Functional Data Structures](https://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504).  It also includes, for some reason, attempts at implementing a zipper for lists, a lens signature/structure, and an option monad in SML.
